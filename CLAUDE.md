## General Pointers
- Follow SOLID principles:
    - Single Responsibility Principle: A class or function should have one purpose only.
    - Open/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - Liskov Substitution Principle: Imagine a function that expects a Bird. You should be able to pass in a Sparrow or a Duck, and it should just work.
    - Interface Segregation Principle: Don't make a big, fat interface with a bunch of unrelated methods. Instead, split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that classes only implement what they actually need.
    - Dependency Inversion Principle: A design rule that says high-level code should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- Conda env is called scale-mvp, make sure to run conda activate scale-mvp when running backend files.
- Avoid using emojis at all. Keep everything professional.
